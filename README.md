# **Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio!** 🎉

Welcome! This is where I showcase my **data science journey**, documenting projects that highlight my growth and curiosity in diverse fields like optimization methods, machine learning, statistics, and more. My adventure started in 2023 with online courses and an internship at **L'Oréal**, and I've been learning and evolving ever since.

In this portfolio, you'll find a curated selection of my projects, with detailed explanations of my approach, key insights, and reflections. Whether you're here for inspiration, feedback, or collaboration, I hope you find these projects insightful. 

💌 **Feel free to reach out** with any questions or feedback via email: [felix-raphael@outlook.com](mailto:felix-raphael@outlook.com).

## 🏙️ **Airbnb Project: Data Analysis using Python and SQL** 

🔗 [Read the full report](Airbnb%20Project/Project%20Report.pdf)  
🔗 [Explore the SQL Queries](Airbnb%20Project/SQL%20queries.txt)  
🔗 [View the Python Data Cleaning Notebook](Airbnb%20Project/Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)

As part of my studies at **RSM**, I tackled a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb data to explore its impact on the city of Paris. The focus was on:

1. **Neighbourhood Listing Density**: Identifying areas with the most listings.
2. **Host Professionalization**: Understanding the relationship between host type and pricing.
3. **Host Type Characteristics**: Investigating how different host types influence the pricing strategies and listing types.

I used Python for data cleaning and preparation, then transitioned to SQL for database management and further analysis. My findings highlight important socio-economic considerations, including the impact of gentrification.

## 🧬 **Leveraging a ML Classifier to detect a Biomedical condition** 

🔗 [Explore the ML Model Notebook](html_files/BioMed_Case_ML_Model_hmtlfile.html)

In this project, I used a **Kaggle dataset** to predict whether a patient has abnormal biomechanical patterns indicative of conditions like **Disk Hernia** or **Spondylolisthesis**. I compared three ML models: **KNN**, **Lasso**, and **Random Forest**.

I dealt with small sample sizes and class imbalances, and evaluated each model based on key performance metrics like **Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)** and **Specificity (True Negative Rate)**. Ultimately, **Random Forest** balanced performance well, but **KNN** performed best in identifying abnormal patients (with a **75% Sensitivity**).

## 🚚 **Hub and Spoke System with Gurobi Optimization using Python** 

🔗 [Check out the notebook](html_files/Gurobi_Optimization_Model.html)

For this project, I worked on optimizing **delivery routes** using a **Hub and Spoke** system. By applying optimization techniques with the **Gurobi** solver, I identified the most efficient hub location for deliveries across India, minimizing travel distance and improving logistics. 

The dataset provided insights into **delivery patterns**, helping me propose the optimal location for a logistics hub in India, located in the **south-eastern region**, where shorter deliveries are more frequent.

## 📈 **Predicting Walmart Sales with Time Series Analysis** 

🔗 [View the Time Series Forecasting Notebook](html_files/Time_Series_Forecasting.html)

In this project, I used **Walmart sales data** from 2010-2021 to explore various **time series forecasting** methods. I compared:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Holt Winters Exponential Smoothing**
- **(S)ARIMA(X)**

I employed **exogenous variables** (like CPI and unemployment rate) to see if they improved predictive accuracy. Results showed that while these variables may boost performance, they can also lead to **overfitting** if not handled carefully.

Performance was measured using **RMSE** and **MAPE**, providing actionable insights into sales forecasting.

## 🎓 **Master Thesis: Optimizing Routes in Attended Home Services** 

🔗 [Read the full Master Thesis](html_files/MasterThesis.html)  
🔗 [Explore the Solution Code](html_files/Solution_Code_stage2_final.py)

My **Master’s thesis** focused on improving route optimization for **attended home deliveries and services**. Companies like **Picnic** already use sophisticated **a priori optimization** methods to plan efficient delivery routes. 

In my study, I explored strategies to balance **efficiency**, **complexity**, and **customer service**. After partitioning customers into groups and assigning appointment days, I optimized daily delivery routes to minimize travel distance. The study found that optimizing **appointment-day offerings** had significant impacts on route efficiency and profitability.

I hope you enjoy exploring these projects and insights! Stay tuned for more exciting additions in the future. 🚀
