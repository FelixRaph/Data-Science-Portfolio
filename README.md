## üß™ **A/B Testing: Does a New Website Feature Improve Customer Behavior?**

[Explore the full notebook here](html_files/AB_Testing.html)

In this project, I explored the impact of a **new website feature** rolled out by an online shopping platform through a controlled **A/B experiment**. Visitors were randomly assigned to one of two groups:  
- The **treatment group**, which interacted with the **updated website** containing the new feature  
- The **control group**, which continued to see the **standard version** without any changes

üîç **Exploratory Analysis**  
I began with an **exploratory data analysis** to investigate potential differences between the two groups. Using **visualizations**, summary statistics, and a **correlation matrix**, I uncovered early signs that the treatment might be influencing user behavior. For instance:
- The new feature seemed to **moderate the relationship between spending and search activity**
- There were **small but positive shifts** in **conversion-related metrics**

üìä **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**  
To go beyond observation and assess whether these patterns were **statistically significant**, I performed **hypothesis testing** on key performance indicators (KPIs). This allowed me to distinguish between **real treatment effects** and random noise.

‚úÖ **Key Finding:**  
The **completion rate** ‚Äî the proportion of items added to cart that were ultimately purchased ‚Äî was **significantly higher** in the treatment group, providing strong evidence that the new feature improved this aspect of the customer journey.

‚ùå **No Significant Effects Found:**  
- **Conversion rate** (searches ‚Üí purchases)  
- **Total number of purchases**

These results indicate that while the feature may not drive more overall purchases, it can help **improve follow-through** once users have shown interest in products.

This project highlights my ability to combine **exploratory analysis**, **data visualization**, and **robust statistical testing** to evaluate the real-world impact of product changes in an experimental setting.

## üè® **What Drives Hotel Popularity on TripAdvisor? A Causal Discovery Project**

üîó [Explore the full Jupyter Notebook](html_files/TripAdvisor_CausalDiscovery_Notebook.html) 

This project explores what makes hotels in Rome more popular on TripAdvisor, using a dataset of **4,599 hotels** and **272 features** including amenities, image counts, and web traffic data. Popularity is measured by the number of clicks each hotel receives.

üí° Project Goals:
- Identify the most important hotel features associated with high user engagement (views on trip advisor).
- Attempt to quantify the causal relationship between the most important user engagement features 

üîß Tools & Libraries:
`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `DirectLiNGAM`, `imblearn`

üß† Methodology:
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaned the data, identified and removed outliers, handled missing values, removed redundant or flawed columns and handled severe class imbalance by randomly over- and undersampling in preparation of applying ML Classifiers.
- **Feature Selection**: Trained ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and used **feature importance** to reduce dimensionality and highlight key drivers of engagement.
- **Causal Discovery**: Applied the **DirectLiNGAM** algorithm to uncover and quantify possible cause-effect relationships between selected features and views.

‚úÖ Key Takeaways:
- Photos strongly impact the number of reviews, with an effect of 0.877.
- The number of reviews has a moderate, direct effect onto the binary target variable `views`, with a causal effect of 0.459.
- Photos have a very weak effect on views and on the adjusted score given.

This project reflects my growing interest in **interpretable machine learning**, and it helped me learn how to move from **correlation to causation** using real-world data. While this is a beginner's step into the challenging domain of Causal Inference, it shows how Machine Learning and Causal Discovery/Inference can be used hand in hand, in order to untangle large amounts of data into a simple overview of causal relationships.

## üéì **Master Thesis: Optimizing Routes in Attended Home Services** 

üîó [Read the full Master Thesis](html_files/MasterThesis.html)  
üîó [Explore the Solution Code](html_files/Solution_Code_stage2_final.py)

My **Master‚Äôs thesis** focused on improving route optimization for **attended home deliveries and services**. Companies like **Picnic** already use sophisticated **a priori optimization** methods to plan efficient delivery routes. 

In my study, I explored strategies to balance **efficiency**, **complexity**, and **customer service**. After partitioning customers into groups and assigning appointment days, I optimized daily delivery routes to minimize travel distance. The study found that optimizing **appointment-day offerings** had significant impacts on route efficiency and profitability.

## üìà **Predicting Walmart Sales with Time Series Analysis** 

üîó [View the Time Series Forecasting Notebook](html_files/Time_Series_Forecasting.html)

In this project, I used **Walmart sales data** from 2010-2021 to explore various **time series forecasting** methods. I compared:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Holt Winters Exponential Smoothing**
- **(S)ARIMA(X)**

I employed **exogenous variables** (like CPI and unemployment rate) to see if they improved predictive accuracy. Results showed that while these variables may boost performance, they can also lead to **overfitting** if not handled carefully.

Performance was measured using **RMSE** and **MAPE**, providing actionable insights into sales forecasting.

## üöö **Hub and Spoke System with Gurobi Optimization using Python** 

üîó [Check out the notebook](html_files/Gurobi_Optimization_Model.html)

For this project, I worked on optimizing **delivery routes** using a **Hub and Spoke** system. By applying optimization techniques with the **Gurobi** solver, I identified the most efficient hub location for deliveries across India, minimizing travel distance and improving logistics. 

The dataset provided insights into **delivery patterns**, helping me propose the optimal location for a logistics hub in India, located in the **south-eastern region**, where shorter deliveries are more frequent.

## üß¨ **Leveraging a ML Classifier to detect a Biomedical condition** 

üîó [Explore the ML Model Notebook](html_files/BioMed_Case_ML_Model_hmtlfile.html)

In this project, I used a **Kaggle dataset** to predict whether a patient has abnormal biomechanical patterns indicative of conditions like **Disk Hernia** or **Spondylolisthesis**. I compared three ML models: **KNN**, **Lasso**, and **Random Forest**.

I dealt with small sample sizes and class imbalances, and evaluated each model based on key performance metrics like **Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)** and **Specificity (True Negative Rate)**. Ultimately, the **Random Forest** performed best in identifying abnormal patients with a **89.47% Sensitivity**, meaning that the model was able to detect almost 9 out of 10 patients with abnormal patterns!

üîó [Explore the SQL Queries](Airbnb%20Project/SQL%20queries.txt)  
üîó [View the Python Data Cleaning Notebook](Airbnb%20Project/Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)

As part of my studies at **RSM**, I tackled a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb data to explore its impact on the city of Paris. The focus was on:

1. **Neighbourhood Listing Density**: Identifying areas with the most listings.
2. **Host Professionalization**: Understanding the relationship between host type and pricing.
3. **Host Type Characteristics**: Investigating how different host types influence the pricing strategies and listing types.

I used Python for data cleaning and preparation, then transitioned to SQL for database management and further analysis. My findings highlight important socio-economic considerations, including the impact of gentrification.
