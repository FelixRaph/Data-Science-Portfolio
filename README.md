## Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!

In this read me file, you can explore the reasoning behind my projects and dive into some explanations and reflections that are meant to make my code more accessible. Enjoy!

In case you have any questions and criticism, please contact me via email to felix-raphael@outlook.com .

The contents in this Portfolio should be embedded and read within a context, which I will elaborate on in the following.

I am currently finishing my Master's degree in Business Analytics & Management at Rotterdam School of Management. As I have a background in Business, I still consider myself at the beginning of my journey in the field of Data Science. Hence, my projects uploaded here do not aim to be overly complex, but reflect my interest and eagerness to learn and practice on rather simple use cases. 

During my academic journey, I found the fields of Machine Learning and Operations Research to be particularly interesting. Apart from that, I will try to incorporate simple Data Analysis and Visualization projects as well on this repository.
