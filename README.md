# **Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio!** üéâ

Welcome! This is where I showcase my **data science journey**, documenting projects that highlight my growth and curiosity in diverse fields like optimization methods, machine learning, statistics, and more. My adventure started in 2023 with online courses, an internship project at **L'Or√©al**, and an Analytics Master's degree at Erasmus University Rotterdam. I've been learning and evolving ever since!

In this portfolio, you'll find a curated selection of my projects, with explanations of my approach, key insights, and reflections. Whether you're here for inspiration, feedback, or collaboration, I hope you find these projects insightful. 

üíå **Feel free to reach out** with any questions or feedback via email: [felix-raphael@outlook.com](mailto:felix-raphael@outlook.com).

## üíª **A/B Testing: Investigating the effectiveness of a new feature**

[Explore the full notebook here](html_files/AB_Testing.html)

In this project, I investigated the effects of a new feature in an experimentation setting. In particular, a shopping website would like to experiment with a new website feature and therefore conducted an experiment in which one group of visitors received the treatment, i.e. they experienced the website **with** the new feature, while the control group saw the usual website version without the new feature (treatment).

I conducted some explorative data analysis and tried to uncover differences between the groups using visualizations and a correlation matrix. This already suggested that there might be some differences that could be induced by the treatment. Based on the preliminary analysis, it seemed that the treatment may reduce the impact of the spend on the number of searches for instance, while it also appeared to slightly boost conversion metrics. 
In the following part, I then performed hypothesis testing, which was designated to finding out whether some of the differences that could be seen in the KPIs are significant and therefore provide support to the effectiveness of the treatment, or simply due to chance, and can therefore not support the claim that the treatment had an impact on the KPIs.

As a result, I discovered a significant difference in groups for the completion rate, which I defined as the rate at which items that are added to the cart are in the end being purchased by the customer. On the flipside, there was no significant treatment effect in the number of purchases or the conversion rate.

## üè® **What Drives Hotel Popularity on TripAdvisor? A Causal Discovery Project**

üîó [Explore the full Jupyter Notebook](html_files/TripAdvisor_CausalDiscovery_Notebook.html) 

This project explores what makes hotels in Rome more popular on TripAdvisor, using a dataset of **4,599 hotels** and **272 features** including amenities, image counts, and web traffic data. Popularity is measured by the number of clicks each hotel receives.

üí° Project Goals:
- Identify the most important hotel features associated with high user engagement (views on trip advisor).
- Attempt to quantify the causal relationship between the most important user engagement features 

üîß Tools & Libraries:
`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `DirectLiNGAM`, `imblearn`

üß† Methodology:
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaned the data, identified and removed outliers, handled missing values, removed redundant or flawed columns and handled severe class imbalance by randomly over- and undersampling in preparation of applying ML Classifiers.
- **Feature Selection**: Trained ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and used **feature importance** to reduce dimensionality and highlight key drivers of engagement.
- **Causal Discovery**: Applied the **DirectLiNGAM** algorithm to uncover and quantify possible cause-effect relationships between selected features and views.

‚úÖ Key Takeaways:
- Photos strongly impact the number of reviews, with an effect of 0.877.
- The number of reviews has a moderate, direct effect onto the binary target variable `views`, with a causal effect of 0.459.
- Photos have a very weak effect on views and on the adjusted score given.

This project reflects my growing interest in **interpretable machine learning**, and it helped me learn how to move from **correlation to causation** using real-world data. While this is a beginner's step into the challenging domain of Causal Inference, it shows how Machine Learning and Causal Discovery/Inference can be used hand in hand, in order to untangle large amounts of data into a simple overview of causal relationships.

## üéì **Master Thesis: Optimizing Routes in Attended Home Services** 

üîó [Read the full Master Thesis](html_files/MasterThesis.html)  
üîó [Explore the Solution Code](html_files/Solution_Code_stage2_final.py)

My **Master‚Äôs thesis** focused on improving route optimization for **attended home deliveries and services**. Companies like **Picnic** already use sophisticated **a priori optimization** methods to plan efficient delivery routes. 

In my study, I explored strategies to balance **efficiency**, **complexity**, and **customer service**. After partitioning customers into groups and assigning appointment days, I optimized daily delivery routes to minimize travel distance. The study found that optimizing **appointment-day offerings** had significant impacts on route efficiency and profitability.

## üìà **Predicting Walmart Sales with Time Series Analysis** 

üîó [View the Time Series Forecasting Notebook](html_files/Time_Series_Forecasting.html)

In this project, I used **Walmart sales data** from 2010-2021 to explore various **time series forecasting** methods. I compared:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Holt Winters Exponential Smoothing**
- **(S)ARIMA(X)**

I employed **exogenous variables** (like CPI and unemployment rate) to see if they improved predictive accuracy. Results showed that while these variables may boost performance, they can also lead to **overfitting** if not handled carefully.

Performance was measured using **RMSE** and **MAPE**, providing actionable insights into sales forecasting.

## üöö **Hub and Spoke System with Gurobi Optimization using Python** 

üîó [Check out the notebook](html_files/Gurobi_Optimization_Model.html)

For this project, I worked on optimizing **delivery routes** using a **Hub and Spoke** system. By applying optimization techniques with the **Gurobi** solver, I identified the most efficient hub location for deliveries across India, minimizing travel distance and improving logistics. 

The dataset provided insights into **delivery patterns**, helping me propose the optimal location for a logistics hub in India, located in the **south-eastern region**, where shorter deliveries are more frequent.

## üß¨ **Leveraging a ML Classifier to detect a Biomedical condition** 

üîó [Explore the ML Model Notebook](html_files/BioMed_Case_ML_Model_hmtlfile.html)

In this project, I used a **Kaggle dataset** to predict whether a patient has abnormal biomechanical patterns indicative of conditions like **Disk Hernia** or **Spondylolisthesis**. I compared three ML models: **KNN**, **Lasso**, and **Random Forest**.

I dealt with small sample sizes and class imbalances, and evaluated each model based on key performance metrics like **Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)** and **Specificity (True Negative Rate)**. Ultimately, the **Random Forest** performed best in identifying abnormal patients with a **89.47% Sensitivity**, meaning that the model was able to detect almost 9 out of 10 patients with abnormal patterns!

üîó [Explore the SQL Queries](Airbnb%20Project/SQL%20queries.txt)  
üîó [View the Python Data Cleaning Notebook](Airbnb%20Project/Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)

As part of my studies at **RSM**, I tackled a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb data to explore its impact on the city of Paris. The focus was on:

1. **Neighbourhood Listing Density**: Identifying areas with the most listings.
2. **Host Professionalization**: Understanding the relationship between host type and pricing.
3. **Host Type Characteristics**: Investigating how different host types influence the pricing strategies and listing types.

I used Python for data cleaning and preparation, then transitioned to SQL for database management and further analysis. My findings highlight important socio-economic considerations, including the impact of gentrification.
